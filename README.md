Hello everyone,

To make life easier for everyone and so that I no longer have to explain how to do it :D I managed to do this program. 
Direct for programmers....your eyes will bleed :D On the other hand, if you extract the textures from UOFIDDLER you 
will directly have the right IDs for the BrushID. The Alphas must also be named A_DL1, A_DR1 etc... and B_DL2 etc... 
I'm a little confused about this....but at least you only have to do it once. 
There is a folder with alphas and another with textures on the github for you to test. 
This allows you to have the Type in the XML, for the rest it's quite simple.
